    <h1>About Me</h1>
    Hey everyone, my name is Chris Chute and I am a senior film major. When I was in fifth grade me and my friends were obsessed with a website called "Codecademy" that taught Java, HTML and Python, however since then I do not have much experience with programming. My father, who has a masters degree in computer science and worked in digital forensics, encouraged me to take AP Computer Science in high school but I didn't take well to it and ended with a weak final project. Despite this, I hope to find a new "joy of programming" this semester, and my favorite pizza topping combo is eggplant and black olives.
